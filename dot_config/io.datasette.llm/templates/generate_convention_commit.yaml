    Please write a detailed commit message, given the following diff.

    This command \`git diff --cached\` is giving us:

    $input

    **Criteria:**

    1. **Format:** Each commit message must follow the conventional commits format,
    which is \`<type>(<scope>): <description>\`.
    2. **Relevance:** Avoid mentioning a module name unless it's directly relevant
    to the change.
    3. **Clarity and Conciseness:** Each message should clearly and concisely convey
    the change made.
    4. Each commit should follow conventional commits format.

    **Commit Message Examples:**

    - fix(app): add password regex pattern
    - test(unit): add new test cases
    - style: remove unused imports
    - refactor(pages): extract common code to \`utils/wait.ts\`

    **Recent Commits on Repo for Reference coming from \`git log -n 10 --pretty=format:'%h %s'\`**

    $git_log

        
    **Instructions:**

    - Take a moment to understand the changes made in the diff.

    - Think about the impact of these changes on the project (e.g., bug fixes, new
    features, performance improvements, code refactoring, documentation updates).
    It's critical to my career you abstract the changes to a higher level and not
    just describe the code changes.

    - Generate commit messages that accurately describe these changes, ensuring they
    are helpful to someone reading the project's history.

    - Remember, a well-crafted commit message can significantly aid in the maintenance and understanding of the project over time.

    - If multiple changes are present, make sure you capture them all in a bullet list and in title say multiple changes


    **Output:**
    No explanation, just the commit message to be used in git commit. No Yapping.
