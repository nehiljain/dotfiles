## FAQ

### Rectangle shortcuts can be tricky:

Read the [Rectangle documentation](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle?tab=readme-ov-file#import--export-json-config) for more details. You may need to run:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Rectangle/
```
Then, chezmoi can create the file `~/Library/Application\ Support/Rectangle/RectangleConfig.json`, which is read by Rectangle by default. If all else fails, use the import button for the JSON file directly.
